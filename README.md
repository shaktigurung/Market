## Development Process:

### Git

1. Create a remote repositoty on github
2. Link that repo to all computers 
3. Create a branch on local repos, called the feature name
4. Any changes would be pushed to a seperate feature branch 
5. Each of us had different methods on when we pushed to gihub
6. Depending on who was adding to the repo, meant that a different amount of changes would occur on the master branch
7. The master branch would then be pulled by the team
8. Then depending on if the feature was complete a new branch would be created

### User Stories / Trello Board

There was an initial Trello board created with very minimal cards and tables. It was fleshed out to include the user stores as well as specific To Do Lists for the team. In hindsight instead of having separate lists, we could have just added a member to a specific card to clean the board up. When things were finished they would be moved to the done list. Anything that we were working on was moved to our personal list.

### Wireframes

The wireframes were created before the ERD (Entityâ€“relationship model). It allowed for the team to come up with what tables would be needed due to the features in the wireframes.

### Designing database

Designing the database was a difficult task for the team. The initial designed did not contain many fields that we needed. The design was then changed to better accommodate our needs. Even though the new design was better than the initial one, additional columns were added to allow for features to be implemented. Additionally, there are also columns that are now redundant and will be dropped from the relevant tables.
